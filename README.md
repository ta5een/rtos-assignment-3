This project provides two programs: `program_1` and `program_2`. To build both
programs, ensure you have `gcc` and `make` installed and run the following
commands:

```sh
$ make
$ ./out/program_1 # To run the CPU Scheduling and FIFO implementation
$ ./out/program_2 # To run the Memory Management and Signal implementation
```
